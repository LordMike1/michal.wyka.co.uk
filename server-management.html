                        <span>Over lockdown, I joined a group of other people who were affected by school closures. We built up a tight-knit community SMP over the months it was active. Naturally, as schools opened it had to finish.<br><br>At it's peak there were about 30 concurrent players in a multitude of factions/groups, with an overall community of around 150. All built in the matter of 2 to 3 months. This is where I started to learn how to do things properly.
