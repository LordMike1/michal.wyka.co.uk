      <description>This section can be interpreted as another critique of democracy and a justification of Socrates’ idea to have philosopher-rulers in the perfect city. Echoing events in Plato’s life, such as the political upheaval in Athens and the execution of Socrates. This part critiques the alternatives to the perfect system of aristocracy. It also refers to Plato’s beliefs in the relationship between the soul and politics^1^. The books surrounding this section also contain anti-democratic and autobiographical themes; the cave story resembles Socrates’ execution; the other political systems reinforce Plato’s argument about aristocracies’ perfection; and how tyranny arises from democracy.</description>
